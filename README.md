# occupancy-workshop

This is a workshop for people unfamiliar with occupancy models! 
It includes a presentation outlining the theory of why and how occupancy models work, and the is followed by some simply data preparation steps, running two different models in JAGS, plotting their output and, finally, thinking about why the two models give different estimates. 

All the objects we make along the way are saved to this repository, including model outputs and figures in case something goes wrong and you cannot run the code. 

The analysis is from [Johnson 2023 - Positive impact of postfire environment on bumble bees not explained by habitat variables in a remote forested ecosystem](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.9743), and the full code for that full project can be seen [here](https://github.com/Hanna-Jackson/bumble_bee_habitat) along with a proper readme file describing in detail what all the data represent.

Thank you for your interest!
