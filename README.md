# occupancy-workshop

This is a workshop for people unfamiliar with occupancy models! 
It includes a presentation outlining the theory of why and how occupancy models work, and the is followed by some simply data preparation steps, running two different models in JAGS, plotting their output and, finally, thinking about why the two models give different estimates. 

It is based on [Johnson 2023 - Positive impact of postfire environment on bumble bees not explained by habitat variables in a remote forested ecosystem](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.9743), and the full code for that full project can be seen [here](https://github.com/Hanna-Jackson/bumble_bee_habitat).

Thank you for your interest!
